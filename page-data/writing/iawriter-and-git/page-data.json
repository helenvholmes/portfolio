However, with Yosemite we can now access our Cloud Drive as a folder in Finder, which means that we can <em>definitely</em> find it in the terminal, which in turn means we can turn out iAWriter folders into git repositories. Score!</p>\n<p>Because the path into the iCloud folder is so nasty, let’s just immediately symlink it:</p>\n<pre><code>ln -s ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/ iCloud</code></pre>\n<p>If you navigate here you’ll notice a bunch of folders for various things. For iAWriter you’re looking for one that has a hash, then <code>jp\\~informationarchitects\\~Writer</code>. Inside that it will have another folder named <code>Documents</code>.</p>\n<p>Inside <code>Documents</code> I created a folder called <code>so-you-are</code> (a book idea I’ve been working on) which I then aliased in my <code>~.zshrc</code> file like so:</p>\n<pre><code>alias soyouare=“~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/74ZAFF46HB~jp~informationarchitects~Writer/Documents/so-you-are”</code></pre>\n<p>Once I navigated into that folder, it was <code>git init</code> and <code>git add remote origin</code> as you’d expect!</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://danielmiessler.com/blog/access-icloud-drive-terminal/\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Miessler</a> who wrote about this in the first place (although his article wasn’t exactly what people wanted, see comments) and this <a href=\"http://superuser.com/questions/827827/access-icloud-drive-via-terminal\" target=\"_blank\">SuperUser thread</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 07, 2015","title":"iAWriter and Git","description":"How to Version Control Your iAWriter Documents","tags":["learning"]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"36cb4d43-ffc9-5492-a4a8-caeec82e3f62"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3020398965"]}
