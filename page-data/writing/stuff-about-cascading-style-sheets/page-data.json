Real data! Real feels! Real interactions! With prototypes, you can actual test it. </p>\n<p>It protomotes systemic design. Design components across pages, not pages of components.</p>\n<p>It allows us to speak the same language. Coded components instead of pixels and design specs allow us to work together.</p>\n<h2>#NewNewTwitter</h2>\n<p>This refers to the mobile clients that came out three years and a day ago on twitter.com.</p>\n<p><em>They did a bajillion Photoshop mockups.</em> Whenever you had to update one, you had to update <em>ALL OF THEM</em>. Terrible.</p>\n<p>Then, they prototyped. EXCEPT THEY WEREN'T BECAUSE NO TIME FOR PRODUCTION-WORTHY CODE.</p>\n<p>In essense:</p>\n<h2>A set of PSDs can't encapsulate the entire web.</h2>\n<p>So, learned:</p>\n<p><em>Consolidate similar design components into one.</em> Getting into code faster allows you to find these things faster. Instead of having six slightly different things, just have one. Less time!</p>\n<p><em>Speed is a feature.</em> Having those components made them move faster so that they <em>could</em> worry about speed, because on a site like Twitter, speed is hella important.</p>\n<h2>Having something actually coded helps with momentum.</h2>\n<p>If you have something prototyped, you can get it approved.</p>\n<p>It's not that old design techniques are antiquated and you should code in the browser and blah blah blah. Because sketching is awesome. It's just that you <em>should</em> try to move into code faster to get things shipped faster.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 11, 2014","title":"Stuff About Cascading Style Sheets","description":"Better product design with HTML & CSS","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"3503567c-c8c8-5355-9c75-f871ea5d5a2d"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3020398965"]}
