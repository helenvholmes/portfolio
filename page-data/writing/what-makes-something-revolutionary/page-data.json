Motivation is the worst thing to rely on. Ability is just how easy it is to get started. Triggers are where you succeed: tools helped us change our behavior by making things easier.</p>\n<p><em>Mid Aughts</em>: Rails comes out in 2005, jQuery in 2006. It wasn't the first framework, but it presented a simple solution: did one thing really well. Dom manipulation! Came with great documentation. And lastly: jQuery invited us to participate. On day two, someone released a plugin. jQuery obviously is incredibly successful, but it's those three design decisions: simple solution, great documentation, community - that made it so popular.</p>\n<p><em>CSS</em>: it's frustrating. Queue the gifs. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>960px ftw</li>\n<li>IE 6, 7, 8, 9, wah</li>\n<li>CSS3, hey gurl</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>The rise of CSS preprocessors where inevitable.</em> CSS was hard, and the iPhone was about to come out. So <a href=\"http://sass-lang.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sass</a> and <a href=\"http://lesscss.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Less</a> came into play. Sass was hard, but then <a href=\"http://compass-style.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Compass</a> came into play: it made Sass <em>easy</em> and it had <em>great</em> documentation. Lastly, it came with, you guessed it: a call for community. Which, in turn, created a larger community:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sache.in/\" target=\"_blank\">Sache Sass</a>, <a href=\"http://breakpoint-sass.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Breakpoint</a>, <a href=\"http://bourbon.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Bourbon</a></p>\n<p><em>These things allowed us to do things ourselves.</em> They nutured community and our ability to design.</p>\n<h2>So what's the point?</h2>\n<p>\"Really, another build tool?\" On the contrary: it's all about allowing us to be open and to generate new ideas.</p>\n<p><em>It's about humanity:</em> Eventually we will worry less about technological problems, and more about human problems. By celebrating diversity and differences in our communities, we'll solve bigger problems. (<em>No cliques!</em>)</p>\n<p><em>We are succeeding!</em> We act as amplifiers and filters. We've created a great network, and we have a lot of contribute. If we continue to innovate in the way we've been doing about (simple solutions, good documentation, happy commuity) we can continue to be revolutionary.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 15, 2014","title":"What Makes Something Revolutionary?","description":"CSSConfOakland!","tags":["conferences"]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"0f15f8d6-0a24-5078-a2f3-bc80dfcd85c3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3020398965"]}
