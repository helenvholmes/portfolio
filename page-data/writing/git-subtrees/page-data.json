I'd refactored my portfolio probably over a month ago to have a <a href=\"https://github.com/greypants/gulp-starter\" target=\"_blank\">nice Gulp setup</a> and use Angular but I'd grounded to a halt with <a href=\"https://github.com/rowoot/gulp-gh-pages/issues\" target=\"_blank\">gulp-gh-pages</a> - either I would run the command and nothing would happen or I'd run into memory issues set in place by Node. Ultimately I found a more elegant solution from <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/cobyism/4730490\" target=\"_blank\">cobyism</a> that used Git. Enter <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-shell\" target=\"_blank\">gulp-shell</a> and we're off to the races!</p>\n<pre><code>var gulp        = require('gulp');\nvar shell       = require('gulp-shell');\n\ngulp.task('deploy', shell.task([\n  'git subtree push --prefix build origin master'\n]));\n</code></pre>\n<p>The Gulp Starter I referenced above splits all of its tasks into separate files which is why I only have one thing in here and I'm requiring gulp again.</p>\n<p>After we require gulp we require gulp-shell, which lets us enter bash commands into our task declarations. We then specify the subfolder we want to push (<code>build</code>), the remote (<code>origin</code>), and then the branch (<code>master</code>). I'm defining master, not gh-pages, because the <code>yourUserName.github.io</code> repo works off of master instead of gh-pages.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 09, 2014","title":"Git Subtrees","description":"HellO!
