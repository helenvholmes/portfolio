Meant you could never grep for anything. This problem caused the three levels of CSS degredation:</p>\n<h2 id=\"determination\">Determination</h2>\n<p>MVP features. Yay, we brought in Sass and we shipped the thing!</p>\n<h2 id=\"development\">Development</h2>\n<p>We improve features, introduce a few bugs, and there's some code stink but it's okay! We'll fix it later.</p>\n<h2 id=\"denial\">Denial</h2>\n<p>Everything still works! Errr monkey no see/no hear/whatever, it's fine. <em>It's fine.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"despair\">Despair</h2>\n<p>Everything is growing so friggin' fast. CSS is growing at three poops per week.</p>\n<p><em>We need to treat CSS like a first-class tool.</em> We write Javascript with linters and with tests; CSS needs these things too!</p>\n<p><em>We need conventions.</em> So, at Stripe they started a component library.</p>\n<p><em>Developers who didn't know CSS used it in their other internal projects.</em> It meant that they didn't have to bother designers for it when they just wanted to get something up quickly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"noconventions\">-No- Conventions</h2>\n<p>Coming up with a convention style speed up developers and kept people from arbitarily adding CSS to the bottoms of Sass files.</p>\n<p>Abstracting away components allows them to easily change things.</p>\n<p>Enter the <a href=\"https://github.com/reworkcss/rework\">Rework</a> framework!</p>\n<h2 id=\"notests\">-No- Tests</h2>\n<p>Testing is hard because of all of the states CSS has. </p>\n<h2 id=\"sowhycare\">So, why care?</h2>\n<p>There are already a bajillion component libraries, I thought!</p>\n<p>With your own component library, you're able to spend 90% of your time building the components and 10% on polish.
