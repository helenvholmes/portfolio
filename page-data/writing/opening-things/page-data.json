With a little digging in its app contents I found an executable and assumed I might be able to alias to something like <code>iA</code> or something less laborious to type if they were longform articles while still retaining the ability to open them in sublime if they were just code READMEs. Options, you know.</p>\n<p>After trying to create a symlink I noticed that nonetheless I couldn't launch the app, for whatever reason. I initially thought that I had botched the symlink but then found that it had something to do with the executable I'd found. Unfortunately, digging around in it did little good, as it was a binary file.</p>\n<p>... Charming.</p>\n<p>Trying to open anything with it with absolute paths to the executable gave me some new information, although I couldn't dig any deeper without access to the code it came from.</p>\n<p>Since it seemed to have issues finding my README file, I gave it the proper path, not that that changed much.</p>\n<p>Curious. After digging around where it suggested I look I wasn't able to launch it even after giving everyone full access to test. Ultimately I just changed all <code>.md</code> files so that they would automatically launch in iA Writer instead, although it wasn't the solution I had hoped for. At the very least, it allows me to just type <code>open README.md</code> and have what I expect to happen.</p>\n<p>Anyone ever tried to do something like this? It would be lovely for certain file types if I had options for which program they were opened in, not just the preferencial program set through Finder.</p>\n<p>UPDATE, as of 9:26pm:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/myobie\" target=\"_blank\">@myobie</a> on Twitter very quickly found a solution, which was exactly what I needed:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenvholmes\">@helenvholmes</a> just FYI you can do &#10;$ open README.md -a iA\\ Writer &#10;(also iA=&quot;open -a iA\\ Writer&quot;)</p>&mdash; Nathan Herald (@myobie) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/myobie/status/563523372718784513\">February 6, 2015</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Absolutely perfect! Immediately aliased in my <code>.zsh</code> profile. Score!
