(Or my favorite, <code>tomato</code>!) For example, <code>Rebecca Purple</code>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ainsleywagon.github.io/color-chart\" target=\"_blank\">Color Chart</a></p>\n<h2>So, how did we get these names?</h2>\n<p>First of all, they're not CSS originals, but web standard originals (which is why you can use them with SVG). X-Window System: they come from one of the first GUI interfaces. </p>\n<p><em>Late 80s</em>: Lots of color names weren't standardized until <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_color_names\" target=\"_blank\">X11</a>. Then, Netspace > HTML Browsers > CSS.</p>\n<h2>So why did it take so long?</h2>\n<p>It takes a long time to get things into spec! Also, we're all familiar with hex values, which has so many possibilities.</p>\n<p><em>But you should still use them!</em> Why? They were put through the ringer for web accessibility. They're not case sensitive, recognized cross-browser, work across HTML &amp; SVG, and last but not least: they have fun names &lt;3</p>\n<p><code>navajowhite</code>: why is it named this and why is it orange?</p>\n<h2>So who was behind this?</h2>\n<p>Paul Ravelling, who got them from Sinclair paint swatches! So why the silly names? Because paint swatches have insane names because there really so many different kinds of beige/off-white.</p>\n<p><em>So why so many beiges/off-whites, anyway?</em>: Because there are so many options for desktop backgrounds. </p>\n<p>A lot of our color names come from Crayola. Are you surprised?</p>\n<h2>Adding Colors</h2>\n<p>This is actually fairly rare. (We're still working off the list published in 1989, with the exception of <code>Rebecca Purple</code>). Even this was added fairly quickly, but to lots of controversy. Web standards people take their jobs very seriously; but should this be something we're allowed to change as a community? Default is boring! Shouldn't we question standards to improve them?</p>\n<h2>Accessibility</h2>\n<p>Hey, people gotta read. Color shouldn't be the only visual means of conveying information.</p>\n<p><em>Color should be used to have fun!</em>: </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://kocha.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Kocha</a></p>\n<p><em>But... I work on serious stuff. Like banks.</em>: So use illustrations as an opportunity to make things beautiful. Don't ask permission, just use pastels.</p>\n<p>(Also, <code>thistle</code> is a beautiful CSS color.)</p>\n<p>We should push for more colors. Because color just comes along with creativity! &lt;3</p>\n<h2>Update, 1/28/15</h2>\n<p>You can now watch <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ainsleywagon\">@ainsleywagon's</a> talk on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciGmOlxRxeg&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Youtube!</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 16, 2014","title":"What's in a Name","description":"Exploring the origins of CSS Namespace Colors","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2ef47c41-08d5-5750-82fc-70ba7e0f604e"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3020398965"]}
