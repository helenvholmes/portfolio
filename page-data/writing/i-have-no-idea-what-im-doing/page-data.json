But enjoy what you're currently doing and chip away at what you're doing right now.</p>\n<h2>The Shit We Don't Know We Don't Know</h2>\n<p>\"I'm not good at this.\" Why do we always say this? We should say instead, \"This challenges me.\" Progress and learning is awesome.</p>\n<p>There types of knowledge:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Shit you know.</p></li>\n<li><p>Shit you know you don't know.</p></li>\n<li><p>Shit you don't know you don't know.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Don't put stuff into the shit you know category; take it <em>out</em> of that last category. This is still broadening your horizons and giving you the tools to learn it when you need. It's the only dangerous category.</p>\n<h2>You feel like a fraud because you know there's a ton you don't know about.</h2>\n<p>Good news is, it means you're iterating and getting better at stuff. Bad news is you probably feel dumb all the time :(</p>\n<p><em>We need help!</em> Our education is not complete. Don't be scared of being a beginner. Truth: We are all bad programmers.</p>\n<h2>We judge others by the end result, and we judge ourselves by the struggle it took us to get there.</h2>\n<p>You don't always know what you can do.</p>\n<p>Set goals. Work joyously. Be Lucky. Share your doubts. Celebrate your wins. Help others.</p>\n<p>\"Inspiration exists but it has to find you working.\" -Picasso</p>\n<p>Henry Miller, <a href=\"http://www.brainpickings.org/2012/02/22/henry-miller-on-writing/\" target=\"_blank\">Commandments of the Daily Routine</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 05, 2014","title":"I Have No Idea What I'm Doing","description":"How you got there","tags":["conferences"]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"18c67a72-efc8-5831-8662-38bd5f09cc93"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3020398965"]}
