            Fastly asked me to help brand their holiday party so they could end
            the year with a bang. The team was inspired by music festivals and
            wanted a solution that worked across their six international
            locationsâ€”everywhere from Tokyo to London.
          </p>
          <p>
            We ended up with a versatile brand that included icons and ribbons
            that could be juxtaposed and played with in a variety of ways to
            create different signage and swag. The icons mapped to each of the
            locations so each location&apos;s party felt custom and unique.
