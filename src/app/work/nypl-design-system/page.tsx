            has dozens of apps that power its various digital entities. When I
            joined in 2019 they had had a few false starts getting a design
            system up and running. I was brought on to pioneer, evangelize, and
            build out a system. I owned producing the React library other
            engineers used, evangelization of the system, running the working
            group, onboarding apps to the system, and follow-ups on its
            adoption.
