            Modern Treasury automatically reconciles 99.9% of payments for
            customers, but that last 0.1% can be a daunting number to manually
            reconcile for customers with thousands of transactions a day. For
            that last 0.1% we rolled out an mapping tool, where customers could
            upload their own data column mappings and use MT&apos;s AI engine to
            quickly reconcile those final data points.

            My part of the project included building the suggestions card that
            could be used across different app views to show AI suggestions. It
            was a fun exercise in getting looping animations and loading
            transitions done with Tailwind, along with group-hover interactions.
