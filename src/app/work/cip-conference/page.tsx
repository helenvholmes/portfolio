          <p>
            Fastly approached me in 2017 to help them rebrand their Customer
            Insights Panel, a small conference that disseminated information
            about their product and allowed customers a chance to work with the
            key players on their team in shaping their product&apos;s future.
          </p>
          <p>
            We settled on a series of illustrations inspired by the conference
            venue (a beautiful hotel in Denver that had a
            smoking-room-post-dinner sort of aesthetic) and by the local
            landscape to create the conference brand, as skiing was on the
            agenda after the conference. Little easter eggs appeared
            throughoutâ€”server stacks and speedometers appeared in places one
            wouldn&apos;t expect. I also designed all of the marketing materials
            and the marketing website.
