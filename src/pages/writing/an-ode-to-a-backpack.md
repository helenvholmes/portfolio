I wanted to revive this long-dead [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/helenvholmes/status/931235204898938880) I wrote a few years ago about my favorite backpack of all time after watching some [Matt D'Avella](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GZKraCQGCM) videos on Youtube about sensationalist clickbait articles. This really was the best backpack I'd ever owned, but not because it was a particular brand.

It was because I'd modded the shit out of it.

This was from back in the day when I didn't know how to sew with a machine yet, so everything I did was hand-done. Couture it was not, but I loved it until it died. 

These days I carry around an incredibly beautiful, unmodded briefcase from [Léo et Violette](https://leoetviolette.com/) that Brian bought me during our travels in France. The stitchwork on it is (unsurprisingly) much better than my own. Should it give out on me I intend to bring it to a local shop and have it repaired.

To my old backpack, R.I.P. you beautiful piece of fabric.
